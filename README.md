## Installation ##

 1. `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/React-Starter-2.0`
 2. `npm install`

 Upon very first installation, the postinstall command in the package.json will build a bundle.js file for you,
 and insert it into the dist folder.

- `npm start` (Normal)

You need to run `npm run build` to apply changes to your 'dist' folders bundle.js if you are not
using the dev server.

Check out how the sample test works, and then head to Jest and Enzyme documentation to learn how to use them.
